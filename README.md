# Area_Calculator
Writing a simple program to calculate the area of shapes. Mainly using to learn Rust

# Part One
This first part will be simply getting up and running. Getting user input, converting the input
into floats in order to do calculations and everything else.

# Part Two
In this part, I will be adding structures into the program. Each shape type will be a structure.
This should simplify the program.
